# React Redux Router Boilerplate with Material UI
This boilerplate is built using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) so you will want to read the User Guide for more goodies.

* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
* [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/)

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tomcolaa/3r-material.git
cd create-react-app-redux
yarn
```

If you get the following error
```bash
Error: Invariant failed: You should not use <Route> outside a <Router>
```
You probably used npm to install the packages or to start the server. Try to remove all node_modules and install them again using yarn. You can do so with the following commands.

```bash
rm -rf node_modules/
yarn
```

## Get started

```bash
yarn start
```
