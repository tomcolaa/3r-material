## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tomcolaa/CRA-redux-material.git
cd create-react-app-redux
yarn
```

If you get the error #Error: Invariant failed you probably used npm to install the packages. Try to remove all node_modules and install them again using yarn. You can do so with the following commands.

```bash
rm -rf node_modules/
yarn
```

## Get started

```bash
yarn start
```

This boilerplate is built using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) so you will want to read the User Guide for more goodies.
